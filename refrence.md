## Project Overview

SmartBlog is a collaborative blogging platform that enables multiple users to contribute to blog posts with different permission levels. The platform features a rich text editor for creating engaging content, a role-based permission system that controls who can create, edit, and publish content, and an approval workflow for suggested edits.

The application addresses the need for team-based content creation where different members may have varying levels of editorial authority. It allows content creators to write drafts, editors to review and suggest changes, and administrators to publish finalized content.

Key objectives of the SmartBlog platform include:
- Facilitating collaborative content creation
- Maintaining quality control through an approval process
- Providing a seamless and intuitive user experience
- Supporting rich content formatting
- Enabling community engagement through comments

## System Architecture

SmartBlog uses a modern full-stack JavaScript architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components.

**Frontend:**
- Single-page application (SPA) built with React
- Client-side routing with Wouter
- UI components from Shadcn UI library
- State management with React Query for server state
- Rich text editing with React Quill

**Backend:**
- Express.js server for API endpoints
- In-memory storage (expandable to PostgreSQL)
- Session-based authentication with Passport.js
- RESTful API design principles

**Communication:**
- HTTP/HTTPS for client-server communication
- JSON for data exchange
- WebSockets for real-time notifications (planned feature)

The architecture is designed for extensibility, allowing for future additions like real-time collaboration, file uploads, and analytics.

## Database Schema

SmartBlog's data model consists of four primary entities:

1. **Users**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number;
     username: string;
     email: string;
     password: string; // Hashed
     role: string; // "author", "editor", "admin"
     createdAt: Date;
     updatedAt: Date;
   }
   ```

2. **Blogs**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     content: string; // Rich text content
     authorId: number; // Reference to User
     status: string; // "draft", "review", "published"
     createdAt: Date;
     updatedAt: Date;
   }
   ```

3. **Edit Suggestions**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number;
     blogId: number; // Reference to Blog
     editorId: number; // Reference to User
     content: string; // Suggested content changes
     status: string; // "pending", "approved", "rejected"
     createdAt: Date;
     updatedAt: Date;
   }
   ```

4. **Comments**
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number;
     blogId: number; // Reference to Blog
     authorId: number; // Reference to User
     content: string;
     createdAt: Date;
     updatedAt: Date;
   }
   ```

These entities are represented in code using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the database. For development and testing, an in-memory implementation is used.
